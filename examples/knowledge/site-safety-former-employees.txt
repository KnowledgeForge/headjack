Former employees

As a company, we take the safety and security of our construction sites very seriously. It is important that we maintain control over who is allowed on our sites at all times. This includes former employees, who may no longer have a legitimate reason to be on the site. To ensure that former employees do not gain access to our construction sites, we recommend the following guidance to site managers:

1. Revoking Access: As soon as an employee leaves our company, their access to our construction sites should be revoked immediately. This includes any access codes, keys, or badges that may have been issued to them during their employment.

2. Communication: Site managers should communicate clearly to all employees, including departing employees, that access to our construction sites is restricted to authorized personnel only. This communication should be made in writing and reinforced verbally during exit interviews.

3. Monitoring: Site managers should monitor all access points to the construction site, including entrances, exits, and perimeter fencing. This may include the use of security cameras and security personnel to monitor the site and ensure that only authorized personnel are allowed on site.

4. Documentation: Site managers should maintain accurate records of all personnel who have access to the construction site. This may include a logbook or electronic record of all personnel entering and leaving the site. Any attempt by a former employee to gain access to the site should be documented and reported immediately.

5. Training: All employees, including site managers, should receive training on our policies and procedures related to site access and security. This training should include the importance of not allowing former employees on the construction site.

By following these guidelines, we can ensure that our construction sites remain secure and that only authorized personnel are allowed on site. If you have any questions or concerns about site access or security, please do not hesitate to contact our company's security team for further guidance.
