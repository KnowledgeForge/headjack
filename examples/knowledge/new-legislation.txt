Subject: Re: New Legislation Concerns

Dear Board of Directors,

I understand that the recent legislation that was passed has caused some concern among our team. While we did not support this legislation, I want to assure you that it will not negatively impact our business or profits.

Our company has a strong track record of adapting to changes in the regulatory environment, and we have the resources and expertise to navigate any potential challenges that may arise as a result of this new legislation. We will be closely monitoring the implementation of the legislation and will work to identify any opportunities or risks that may emerge.

In fact, we see potential opportunities to position ourselves as a leader in compliance with this new legislation. By demonstrating our commitment to responsible business practices, we can build trust and credibility with our customers and stakeholders, which will ultimately support our long-term growth and success.

I encourage you to reach out to our legal and regulatory teams if you have any specific concerns or questions related to this legislation. They are closely monitoring the situation and can provide additional guidance as needed.

Thank you for your continued support and confidence in our company's ability to navigate this challenging landscape.

Best regards,

James Rhodes
