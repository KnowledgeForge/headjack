Bob: "Guys, we have a major problem. The app we built for the safety specialists is causing some serious issues."

Alice: "What kind of issues, Bob?"

Bob: "It's giving them wrong data about the work zone, which can be dangerous for the workers and the commuters passing through. They have already reported a few near-miss incidents. We need to fix this ASAP."

Charlie: "Okay, let's start by identifying the root cause of the problem. Did anyone make any changes to the API recently?"

Bob: "No, not that I'm aware of. But the issue started happening after the latest release, so it must be related to that."

Alice: "Alright, let's roll back the release and see if that fixes the issue. We can then work on identifying the specific bug."

Charlie: "Good idea, Alice. But we also need to make sure we inform the safety specialists about this. They might have some temporary workarounds they can use in the meantime."

Bob: "Yeah, let me talk to the safety team and see what they suggest. I'll also coordinate with the project manager and the product owner to keep them in the loop."

Alice: "Great. In the meantime, I'll start debugging the app and see if I can find any issues with the code."

Charlie: "I'll help you with that, Alice. Let's get this fixed before it becomes a bigger problem."
