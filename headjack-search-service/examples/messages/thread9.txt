Sarah: Hey everyone, I wanted to give an update on the bridge repair project. We've hit a bit of a snag.

John (Lead Engineer): What happened?

Sarah: We discovered some unexpected structural damage during the inspection. We'll need to make some significant changes to the design to address it.

Alice (Safety Specialist): Does that mean we need to pause construction until the new design is finalized?

Sarah: Yes, unfortunately. We can't risk worker safety or the integrity of the bridge.

Mark (Financial Analyst): How much is this going to cost us?

Sarah: We're still crunching the numbers, but it's not going to be cheap. We'll need to submit a change order to the client and negotiate additional funds.

Emily (Business Analyst): I'll work on the change order and update the budget accordingly.

Sarah: Thanks, Emily. Also, we'll need to update the project timeline and notify all stakeholders about the delay.

Tom (Regulatory Expert): Do we need to involve any regulatory agencies since the project scope has changed?

Sarah: Yes, good point, Tom. I'll reach out to the relevant agencies and get their approval before we proceed.

John: Can we expedite the design process to minimize the delay?

Sarah: We're already working on it, but we can't rush it and compromise on quality. We'll keep everyone updated on the progress.

Alice: What about the workers who were already scheduled to work on the bridge?

Sarah: We'll reassign them to other projects until the work on the bridge can resume.

Mark: This is going to put a dent in our revenue projections for this quarter.

Emily: I'll work on updating the financial forecasts based on the revised timeline and cost projections.

Sarah: Thanks, everyone. Let's stay focused and work together to get through this.
