**Eva:** Hey team, I just got word that the safety training we had scheduled for next week is getting canceled.

**Delia:** What? That's terrible news. We've been looking forward to this training for weeks.

**Tijmen:** What happened? Why is it getting canceled?

**Eva:** Apparently, the training instructor had a family emergency and won't be able to make it.

**Delia:** Oh no, I hope everything is okay with their family.

**Tijmen:** Definitely. But what are we going to do about the training? We can't just skip it.

**Eva:** Well, I've been in touch with our safety director, and he's already working on a solution. He's looking for an alternative instructor or a rescheduling the training.

**Delia:** That's a relief. I was worried we'd have to miss out on this important training.

**Tijmen:** Yeah, safety is our top priority, and we can't afford to let our guard down. I'm glad our safety director is on top of it.

**Eva:** Absolutely. We have a great team, and I know we'll figure it out. Plus, this gives us some extra time to review our safety procedures and make sure we're up to speed.

**Delia:** That's a good point. We can use this time to refresh our knowledge and be even more prepared for the training when it does happen.

**Tijmen:** You're right. Let's turn this setback into an opportunity to improve our safety practices and come out stronger on the other side.
