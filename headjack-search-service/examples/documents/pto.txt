Subject: Updated Paid Time Off and Sick Leave Policy Announcement

Dear Team,

I hope this email finds you well. As the Head of HR, I wanted to take a moment to inform you about some important updates to our company's Paid Time Off (PTO) and Sick Leave policy, which will be effective starting from the upcoming month.

At [Company Name], we believe in fostering a positive work-life balance for our employees and ensuring their overall well-being. We understand that taking time off for personal reasons or dealing with illness is an integral part of maintaining a healthy and productive workforce. With that in mind, we have revised and enhanced our PTO and Sick Leave policy to better support you.

Key highlights of the updated policy are as follows:

1. Paid Time Off (PTO):
   - All regular full-time employees will be entitled to [X] days of PTO annually.
   - PTO days can be used for vacation, personal appointments, family obligations, or any other non-sick leave purposes.
   - PTO should be requested in advance, preferably with reasonable notice to ensure proper scheduling and staffing arrangements.
   - Unused PTO days can be carried forward to the following year, up to a maximum of [X] days. However, excess accrued PTO cannot be carried over beyond that limit.

2. Sick Leave:
   - All regular full-time employees will be entitled to [X] days of sick leave per calendar year.
   - Sick leave can be utilized for personal illness, medical appointments, or to care for an immediate family member with a health issue.
   - If you are unable to report to work due to illness, please notify your supervisor or the HR department as soon as possible, preferably before the start of your scheduled shift.
   - For extended illnesses that require more than [X] consecutive days off, employees may be required to provide appropriate medical documentation.

3. Time Off Request and Approval:
   - All time off requests, including PTO and sick leave, should be submitted through our designated time-off management system [mention system name]. Instructions on how to use the system will be provided separately.
   - Managers will review and approve time-off requests based on operational needs, workload, and team coverage requirements. We encourage managers to accommodate reasonable time-off requests whenever possible.

Please note that this policy applies to all full-time employees. Part-time employees and employees on other types of leave may have different policies that are outlined in their respective employment agreements or applicable laws.

We believe that these updates will improve transparency, provide you with more flexibility, and ensure fairness across the organization. We value your commitment and hard work, and it is our intention to support your well-being while maintaining our high standards of service and productivity.

If you have any questions or need further clarification regarding the updated policy, please don't hesitate to reach out to the HR department. We are here to assist you.

Thank you for your attention and cooperation in adhering to our revised PTO and Sick Leave policy. We appreciate your contributions to our company's success.

Best regards,

Marge Hill
Head of HR
