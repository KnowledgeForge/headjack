The full bench and endhaul techniques are commonly used in construction for the excavation and transportation of materials, typically in road construction or earthwork projects. These techniques involve the removal of material from a designated area and its subsequent transport to another location. Here's an overview of each technique:

1. Full Bench Technique:
The full bench technique involves the complete excavation of materials from a designated area, such as a hillside or embankment, to create a flat or leveled surface. This technique is often employed when there is excess material that needs to be removed or when the existing terrain needs to be altered for construction purposes.

The process of the full bench technique typically includes the following steps:

- Excavation: Heavy machinery, such as excavators or bulldozers, is used to remove the material from the designated area. The excavation is carried out in layers or lifts to ensure stability and proper compaction.

- Shaping and Grading: After the excavation, the material is shaped and graded to achieve the desired contours and slopes. This may involve using grading equipment to achieve proper compaction and smoothness.

- Removal of Excess Material: In some cases, the excavated material may be excess and needs to be hauled away from the construction site. This is where the endhaul technique comes into play.

2. Endhaul Technique:
The endhaul technique involves the transportation of excavated materials from the construction site to another location, typically an area where the material is needed, such as a fill site or a location where the material can be used for embankments, backfilling, or other purposes.

The process of the endhaul technique generally includes the following steps:

- Loading: The excavated material is loaded onto trucks or other hauling equipment. This may involve the use of loaders, conveyor belts, or other loading machinery.

- Transportation: The loaded trucks or hauling equipment transport the material to the desired location. This may involve local or long-distance transportation, depending on the project requirements.

- Unloading and Placement: Upon reaching the designated location, the material is unloaded and placed in the desired area. The material may be spread out and compacted to achieve the required density and stability.

Both the full bench and endhaul techniques are employed to efficiently manage materials during construction projects. By excavating and removing excess material using the full bench technique and transporting it to another location using the endhaul technique, construction sites can be properly prepared, excess materials can be utilized, and desired grades and contours can be achieved. These techniques help ensure efficient project execution, cost savings, and appropriate utilization of excavated materials while meeting design and engineering specifications.

It's worth noting that the application and suitability of these techniques may vary depending on project-specific factors, site conditions, local regulations, and project requirements. Professional engineering and construction expertise should be employed to ensure the proper implementation of these techniques.
